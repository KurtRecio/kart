          My name is Kurt Mykel P. Recio. In this 1st quarter of grade 9, I've definetly learned a lot. I've also made a lot o new friends. They definitely helped me get through this quarter. we're kind of like a symbiotic relationship. We need each other. I fully expected grade 9 to be extremly hard, but it still feels like grade 8 difficulty but with different lessons. It helps that most of the teachers are really good at teaching. They also make their lessons fun. Though there are still times where they are not able to go to class, so we either have freetime or they give an activity. My favorite subjects are definetly science and mapeh. Science has been my favorite since I was in elementary. I love mapeh because all of our lessons and performance tasks, i'm already good at, like volleyball. This school year is also my first full year of being a class officer. I am one of the peace officers in fidelity. I do like my role, but sometimes i get tired especially when my classmates won't listen. That doesnt happen often though since they have a lot of respect for me. Even though im the youngest, my classmates still trust and listen to my instructions.

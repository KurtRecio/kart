<h1>Reflection</h1>
<p>I learned a lot this second quarter. I learned how to be a team player considering all the events that happened to today. I also learned to be more confident in my talents in my abilities. With all the events in this quarter, I joined the volleyball intrams and won 1st runner up. I joined the oratorical competition and won 3rd place in the grade9-10 bracket. I participated at the book parade dressed as Vinsmoke Sanji from one piece with lots of people complimenting my look. I also joined and will be participating in the upcoming MVP as the representative of fidelity with Rodilyn as my partner. Ive also made new friends. I think i've become much more closer to everyone in Fidelity. I've learned a lot in school and in life, and I'm prepared and exited for what I will learn next quarter.
